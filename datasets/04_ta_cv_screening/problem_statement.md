## **4. Recruitment Screening & Shortlisting Agent**

**Context:** TA/Recruiters handle multiple active JDs simultaneously, manually screening each CV (read → compare against JD → evaluate → note in tracking sheet). Evaluation quality is inconsistent; good candidates are easily missed due to fatigue or high CV volume, and handwritten outreach messages are prone to errors (wrong name/company).

**Input:** A Job Description (JD) + a pool of candidate CVs.

**The agent must:**

1. Parse JD & extract screening criteria (tech stack, YOE, domain, English level)
2. Search & rank CVs by relevance to JD
3. Evaluate each CV with % fit score + explanation per criteria
4. Highlight candidate strengths & gaps
5. Draft shortlist summary report to (which is sent to Hiring Manager)
6. Draft personalized outreach messages (mentioning candidate's projects and past companies)

**Expected output:** Ranked shortlist with per-candidate fit report + ready-to-send personalized outreach messages.

**Why agentic:** Requires structured evaluation with consistent criteria + personalized content generation + multi-step reasoning (parse → match → score → explain → draft).

**Guardrails:**

* No auto-reject. Only rank low + flag for human review.
* TA must approve outreach before sending.
* Manual workload becomes unmanageable when CV volume spikes. Agents must scale without quality degradation.
