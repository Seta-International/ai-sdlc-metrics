# 12 — Iterative Supervisor Topology

**Design §§:** §3.1 (Iterative Supervisor Topology), §2.1 (two-topology runtime), §4 (error classes).

**Activation gate:** Beta. Two-phase bounded (plans 02-03) ships first so gateway, registry, phase executor, streaming contract, observability stabilize under a constrained topology. Iterative activates when router classifies its first real open-ended task OR product explicitly enables for a specific use case.

---

## 1. Scope

### In

- Router `topology: 'iterative'` classification path (extension of plan 02 router plan shape).
- Iterative orchestrator: picks one sub-agent per iteration, executes, evaluates completion scorers, re-plans or exits.
- Per-iteration cost + wallclock gates enforced BETWEEN iterations.
- Turn-scoped taint persistence (not iteration-scoped).
- `SetaScorer.kind: 'deterministic'` completion scorers only (LLM-judge GA-gated).
- Per-turn iteration caps (10 interactive, 20 async).
- Synthesizer runs once after loop exit.
- Iteration event triplet `iteration.started / .validated / .ended` activation (SSE contract defined in plan 06; this plan activates it).
- Observability: new `iteration_count_exceeded_p95` + `topology_downgrade_candidate` signals.
- Replay determinism preservation: iterative turns are replay-deterministic iff all scorers deterministic.

### Out

- LLM-judge scorers for completion gates (GA activation-gated; deferred from §3.1 invariant 4).
- Per-iteration synthesizer (GA activation-gated).
- Mid-loop human-in-loop pause (§10 turn-termination rule — iterative turns still end at "draft submitted").
- Unified `agent | workflow | tool` primitives (rejected; sub-agents are homogeneous).
- Topology mid-turn switch (bounded cannot become iterative mid-turn; router decides at entry).

## 2. Design Context

**Iterative is the second supported topology, not a replacement for bounded.** Two-phase bounded (plan 03) serves ~90% of HR/Time/Projects/Finance/KPI queries well. Iterative serves the other ~10%: open-ended investigation ("why did KPI X regress?"), multi-step planning ("build a comparison across 5 dimensions"), anything whose plan shape cannot be fixed before the first tool call returns.

**Router classifies topology at entry, alongside the plan.** This is the critical decision: does this intent fit bounded (≤3 parallel + 1 sequential) or does it need iterative re-planning? Router heuristic at MVP Beta activation: keyword + intent-pattern match (explicit product-tunable allowlist of iterative-apt patterns). GA: structured classification against a labeled corpus.

**Inline copilots stay bounded-only by hard contract** (§3). Inline = single sub-agent; iterative would break the contract. Enforced at router entry: inline surface + iterative topology → immediate fallback to bounded or escalate to global chat.

**Invariants specific to iterative:**

1. **Per-turn iteration cap** — hard ceiling prevents runaway. Default 10 for interactive, 20 for async. Exceeding aborts `reason: budget`.
2. **Per-iteration cost + wallclock gates** enforced between iterations, not only within sub-agent. A sub-agent may stay under its own wallclock but iterations stack — need cumulative check.
3. **Taint is turn-scoped, persists across iterations.** Once flipped, any draft from any subsequent iteration inherits the approval-tier bump.
4. **Completion scorers rule-based or structural only in v1.** LLM-judge exit gating requires meta-eval first (plan 10 Beta path).
5. **Synthesizer runs once** after loop exit. Per-iteration synth deferred.
6. **Replay determinism** conditional on all scorers being deterministic — enforced at registration (plan 10 `SetaScorer.kind` discriminator).
7. **Topology downgrade signal** emitted when bounded fires its one re-plan; suggests router misclassified.

**Router re-plans in iterative are different from bounded's one-shot plan.** In iterative, every iteration IS a re-plan; the router's first plan is "try this sub-agent first with this directive," then on re-entry "given what we learned, try this next." This is exactly what our §2.1 pre-1.1 spec rejected — we bring it back as a named opt-in topology, not as runtime-wide behavior.

**Rejected alternatives:**

- Mastra-style unbounded `dountil(scorer passes)` (spike 01). Our hard cap + scorer-kind restriction preserves cost predictability + replay determinism.
- Arbitrary DAG / phase 3+ (§16 Out of Scope). Iterative covers the "complex plan" case with less architectural surface.
- LLM-judge scorers in gating at MVP/Beta. Gated on plan 10 Beta meta-eval before GA.

**What this is NOT:** a general-purpose supervisor framework. It is a strictly-bounded iterative loop with opinionated invariants.

## 3. Data Model

### Router plan shape extension (plan 02 `RouterPlan`)

```
type RouterPlan =
  | { topology: 'bounded'; phase1: SubAgentDirective[1..3]; phase2?: SubAgentDirective; disambiguation?: string }
  | { topology: 'iterative'; initialDirective: SubAgentDirective; completionCriteria: CompletionSpec; disambiguation?: string }

type CompletionSpec = {
  scorerIds: string[];        // references registered deterministic scorers (plan 10)
  strategy: 'all' | 'any';
  maxIterations: number;      // <= 10 interactive; <= 20 async
  hintToRouter: string;       // what "done" means for this task, in prose (router uses to re-plan)
}
```

### `agent_iteration` (audit trail per iteration)

- `id UUID PK`.
- `trace_id UUID` (RLS via tenant_id).
- `tenant_id UUID`.
- `turn_id UUID` — correlates to `TURN` span.
- `iteration_number INT` — 1-based.
- `sub_agent_key TEXT` — which sub-agent ran.
- `selection_reason TEXT` — router's rationale.
- `completion_scorer_results JSONB` — `ScorerResult[]`.
- `is_complete BOOLEAN`.
- `started_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `ended_at TIMESTAMPTZ`.
- `usage JSONB` — iteration's token/cost snapshot.
- `taint_at_start BOOLEAN` — turn taint state at iteration start.
- Index: `(turn_id, iteration_number)`.

Per §9 replay-determinism invariant: iteration trace rows are part of the 100% capture for iterative turns.

### Iterative turn extensions to `TurnState`

Additional in-memory fields per iterative turn:

- `iterationNumber: number` — current 1-based.
- `completionCriteria: CompletionSpec` — from router plan.
- `iterationHistory: IterationRecord[]` — for replan context.
- `cumulativeCostUsd: number`.
- `cumulativeWallclockMs: number`.

```
type IterationRecord = {
  iterationNumber: number;
  subAgentKey: string;
  directive: SubAgentDirective;
  output: SubAgentOutput;
  scorerResults: ScorerResult[];
  isComplete: boolean;
}
```

---

## 4. Interface Contracts

### Extended `RouterDecisionParser` (plan 02 augmentation)

```
parse(rawLlmOutput, schema): ParseResult
// schema extended to match `RouterPlan` discriminated union above.
```

Rejection rule: at inline surface, iterative plan → treat as parse error; router retries with explicit "use bounded topology" system message.

### `IterativeOrchestrator`

```
execute(opts: {
  initialPlan: { topology: 'iterative'; initialDirective; completionCriteria };
  turnState: TurnState;
  abortSignal: AbortSignal;
  streamEmitter: StreamEmitter;
}): Promise<PhaseExecutionResult>
```

Same `PhaseExecutionResult` contract as plan 03's `PhaseExecutor.execute` — the caller (plan 06) doesn't need to branch on topology.

### `IterativeRePlanner`

```
replan(opts: {
  turnState: TurnState;
  priorIteration: IterationRecord;
  completionCriteria: CompletionSpec;
}): Promise<{
  kind: 'continue';
  nextDirective: SubAgentDirective;
} | {
  kind: 'exit';
  reason: 'complete' | 'stuck' | 'disambiguation';
  disambiguationQuestion?: string;
}>
```

Calls the router LLM with iteration history + completion hint + last iteration's output.

### `CompletionScorerRunner`

```
runScorers(opts: {
  scorerIds: string[];
  strategy: 'all' | 'any';
  iterationOutput: SubAgentOutput;
  turnState: TurnState;
}): Promise<{
  isComplete: boolean;
  results: ScorerResult[];
}>
```

Scorers resolve via plan 10 `ScorerRegistry`. Registration-time check: scorerIds in CompletionSpec must all be `kind: 'deterministic'`. Violation at router parse → reject plan, re-invoke router with "use only deterministic scorers."

### `IterationCeilingEnforcer`

```
checkBeforeIteration(opts: {
  turnState: TurnState;
  iterationNumber: number;
  completionCriteria: CompletionSpec;
}): {
  allowed: boolean;
  reason?: 'max_iterations' | 'cumulative_cost' | 'cumulative_wallclock';
}
```

Reads `turnState.cumulativeCostUsd`, `cumulativeWallclockMs`, `iterationNumber` vs config limits.

### Extended SSE events (from plan 06, activated here)

`iteration.started`, `iteration.validated`, `iteration.ended` — plan 06 ships the wire format; this plan activates emission.

---

## 5. Control Flow

### Router classification

1. User sends turn; plan 02 router assembles prompt with **topology classification** section.
2. Router emits plan with `topology: 'bounded' | 'iterative'`.
3. Validation (per topology):
   - Bounded: phase1 size ≤3, phase2 size ≤1 (plan 03).
   - Iterative: `completionCriteria.scorerIds` all exist + all `kind: 'deterministic'`; `maxIterations ≤ 10` (interactive) or `≤ 20` (async).
4. **Inline surface guard**: if `topology: 'iterative'` AND `surface === 'inline:*'` → reject plan; force bounded retry.
5. Plan passed to appropriate orchestrator: `PhaseExecutor` (bounded) or `IterativeOrchestrator` (iterative).

### Iterative execution loop

1. `IterativeOrchestrator.execute(...)` receives initial plan.
2. Set `turnState.iterationNumber = 1`.
3. **Loop:**
   a. `IterationCeilingEnforcer.checkBeforeIteration(...)` — if not allowed → exit with `partial` kind.
   b. Emit `iteration.started { n, sub_agent_domain, selection_reason }` SSE event.
   c. Spawn single `SubAgentRunner.run(...)` with current directive + `phase: 1`. Sub-agent's ReAct loop runs per plan 03.
   d. Collect `SubAgentOutput`; record in `iterationHistory`.
   e. Update cumulative cost + wallclock.
   f. Emit `iteration.ended { n, is_complete: TBD, usage }` once sub-agent returns.
   g. `CompletionScorerRunner.runScorers(...)` against iteration output.
   h. Emit `iteration.validated { n, passed, scorer_results, max_iterations_reached }`.
   i. If `isComplete || maxIterationsReached` → break loop.
   j. `IterativeRePlanner.replan(...)`:
   - Returns `continue` with next directive → `iterationNumber += 1`, continue loop.
   - Returns `exit (disambiguation)` → exit loop, emit disambiguation.
   - Returns `exit (stuck)` → exit loop with partial.
4. Post-loop: `Synthesizer.synthesize(...)` with ALL iteration outputs as multi-source input (plan 03's synthesizer shape unchanged; iterative just provides N iteration outputs instead of phase1 + phase2).
5. Return `PhaseExecutionResult`.

### Taint persistence across iterations

1. Iteration 1: no taint.
2. Iteration 1's tool call returns `tenantAuthoredFreeText` field → plan 01 gateway flips `turnState.tainted = true`. Added to `turnState.taintSources`.
3. Iteration 2 starts: `turnState.tainted` already true. Runner records `taint_at_start: true` in `agent_iteration` row.
4. Iteration 2 drafts a write → plan 08 draft classifier sees `turnState.tainted`, bumps tier regardless of which iteration originated the taint.
5. Iteration N drafts: same bump applies.

**Turn-scoped, not iteration-scoped.** Reset to false only at turn end (next turn starts clean).

### Cumulative ceiling enforcement

1. Each iteration's cost added to `turnState.cumulativeCostUsd` at completion.
2. Before starting iteration N: check `cumulativeCostUsd + estimated_next_iteration_cost < per_turn_budget`.
3. Exceeded → `IterationCeilingEnforcer` returns `{ allowed: false, reason: 'cumulative_cost' }`.
4. Orchestrator exits loop with partial; emits `turn.ended.reason: budget`.
5. Partial-answer gate (plan 03 R-03.19) applies: synthesizer runs against iterations so far if no writes drafted.

### Re-plan via router LLM

1. `IterativeRePlanner.replan(...)` calls router LLM with:
   - Original user utterance.
   - Completion criteria hint.
   - `iterationHistory` — sanitized via `project_to_schema` per next sub-agent's scope.
   - Last iteration's sanitized summary.
2. Router responds with new `SubAgentDirective` OR `{ exit: 'disambiguation', question }`.
3. Same structured-output parse + retry semantics as plan 02 (one retry on schema fail → escalate).

### Topology-downgrade signal

1. Bounded turn fires its one bounded re-plan (plan 03 phase-shape mismatch).
2. Plan 07 emits metric `router_rechose_after_replan` + trace attr `topology_downgrade_candidate: true`.
3. Dashboard aggregates: if this signal fires sustained on similar-utterance patterns, it suggests router should be classifying these as iterative.
4. Operator adjusts router classification heuristic / training corpus.

### Inline surface rejection

1. Inline copilot sends turn; surface = `'inline:planner:overview'`.
2. Router misclassifies as iterative.
3. Orchestrator selector checks: `surface.startsWith('inline:') && topology === 'iterative'` → reject.
4. Router re-invoked with explicit system message: "This is an inline surface. Use bounded topology with single sub-agent."
5. Second pass returns bounded plan. Execution proceeds.
6. If router twice attempts iterative on inline → hard refusal with `reason: 'disambiguation'` and UI hint: "This request is too complex for inline; open global chat."

### Replay determinism

1. Iterative turn completes; all iterations + scorer results persisted via 100% capture (iterative turns ALWAYS trigger 100% sample due to `approval_required_draft_submitted` or ceiling hits or taint — OR we explicitly add `topology: 'iterative'` as a sampling trigger).
2. Plan 10 `ReplayHarness.replay(traceId, mode: 'full')` reconstructs:
   - Initial plan.
   - Each iteration's directive.
   - Each iteration's sub-agent output.
   - Each iteration's scorer results.
   - Re-plan LLM calls with full history context.
3. Determinism condition: all scorers deterministic → replay reproduces identical branching. LLM-judge scorer → replay non-deterministic (rejected at plan 10 registration).

## 8. Observability Surface

### Spans

- `TURN` root with attr `topology: 'iterative'`.
- `ITERATION` span per iteration (entity `SUB_AGENT`); attrs `iteration_number`, `sub_agent_key`, `selection_reason`, `is_complete`, `taint_at_start`, `scorer_results`.
- `REPLAN:llm-call` — child of `TURN` (not of `ITERATION`); emitted when router re-plans between iterations.
- `COMPLETION_SCORER:run` — child of `ITERATION`.

### Metrics

- `agent_turn_iterations_total{tenant_id, outcome}` — histogram over iteration count.
- `agent_iteration_count_exceeded_p95{tenant_id}` — gauge (new sampling trigger).
- `agent_topology_downgrade_candidate_total{tenant_id}` — counter.
- `agent_replan_llm_call_total{tenant_id, outcome}` — counter.
- `agent_completion_scorer_fail_total{tenant_id, scorer_id}` — counter.
- `agent_iterative_turn_total{tenant_id, outcome}` — counter.

### Dashboards

- Topology distribution per tenant (bounded vs iterative).
- Iteration count p50/p95/p99.
- Re-plan LLM cost per iterative turn.
- Scorer pass rate per scorer-id.
- Topology-downgrade-candidate rate (router misclassification signal).

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Turn-scoped taint persistence** is the key defense across iterations. A tenant-authored injection in iteration 1 bumps every subsequent iteration's drafts. Verified by seeded test.
- **Deterministic-only scorers.** LLM-judge scorers at exit gate opens a prompt-injection vector (scorer LLM sees tool results, could be told "mark complete"). Deterministic rule-based scorers have no such surface.
- **Iteration cap is a DoS defense.** Runaway iterations consume LLM cost; hard cap bounds worst case.
- **Inline surface rejection.** Iterative turns on inline surface would violate single-sub-agent contract + blow up inline UX (no phase stepper to show 10+ iterations).
- **Re-plan context size discipline.** Unbounded iteration-history context to the re-planner is itself a DoS on the re-plan LLM call cost. Capped to last N + compression.
- **Async iterative.** Event-triggered async can iterate; combined with taint seeding, means an event payload can drive a multi-iteration turn. Max-iterations-per-async-turn is 20 (R-12.5); combined with per-delegation cost ceiling (plan 09), attack surface bounded.

## 10. Performance Budget

| Operation                                       | p50                              | p95     | p99                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Router classification (bounded-or-iterative)    | <10ms additional vs pure bounded | <25ms   | <60ms                                        |
| Per-iteration overhead (orchestrator loop body) | <30ms                            | <80ms   | <200ms                                       |
| `IterativeRePlanner.replan` LLM call            | <2000ms                          | <5000ms | <8000ms                                      |
| Completion scorer run (deterministic)           | <100ms                           | <300ms  | <800ms                                       |
| Total iterative turn (5 iterations avg)         | <12s                             | <30s    | <60s (async: wallclock not strictly bounded) |

Interactive iterative wallclock ceiling: extend plan 06's default 30s to 60s for iterative turns (surface-dependent; configurable).

---

## 11. Testing Strategy

### Unit

- Router plan parser: `topology: 'iterative'` with invalid `scorerIds` → rejected; valid → accepted.
- `IterationCeilingEnforcer`: cumulative cost exceeded → not allowed; iteration count exceeded → not allowed; within limits → allowed.
- `CompletionScorerRunner`: `strategy: 'all'` + any scorer fails → `isComplete: false`; `strategy: 'any'` + any scorer passes → `isComplete: true`.
- Inline surface guard: surface starts with `inline:` + iterative plan → rejected.

### Integration

- Happy iterative turn: 3-iteration investigation; scorer passes at iteration 3; synthesizer produces narrative with provenance across 3 iterations.
- Max iterations reached: 10 iterations never complete → exit with partial; `turn.ended.reason: budget`; partial answer surfaced.
- Taint persistence: iteration 1 taints; iteration 3 drafts write → draft high_risk + provenance includes tainted source from iteration 1.
- Cumulative cost exhausted: iterations 1-3 consume 80% of turn budget; iteration 4 estimate > remaining → exit before starting iteration 4; partial synthesizer.
- Re-plan schema fail: seeded router returns malformed JSON on iteration 4 re-plan; retry once; second fail → exit with disambiguation.
- Inline rejection: inline surface + router returns iterative plan → router retries; second iterative → hard refusal "open global chat."
- LLM-judge scorer attempt: completion criteria references `kind: 'llm-judge'` → plan rejected at registration check.
- Observability: topology-downgrade signal fires when bounded hits one-re-plan on a real turn.

### Property

- Iteration numbering: iterations strictly monotonic, no gaps.
- Cumulative accumulation: sum of per-iteration usage = turn-end usage.

### E2E

- Real investigation scenario in `web-planner`: user asks "why did my project's KPI regress?" → router picks iterative → 4 iterations pulling from timesheet, insights, project modules → synthesizer produces narrative with per-iteration citations → user sees answer.
- Turn cancel mid-iterative: user cancels at iteration 5 → all in-flight aborts → partial synthesizer (or suppressed if writes drafted) → `turn.ended.reason: cancelled`.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

- All unit + integration + property + E2E tests pass.
- Iterative topology ships dormant at MVP (plan 06 events defined but never fired).
- Beta activation: first production iterative turn serves a real user query that two-phase bounded couldn't serve cleanly.
- Taint persistence verified end-to-end.
- Iteration cap enforcement verified.
- Inline surface rejection verified.
- LLM-judge scorer rejection at registration verified (cross-check plan 10).
- Topology-downgrade-candidate signal wired + dashboarded.
- Replay determinism verified on a multi-iteration captured trace.

---

## 13. Rollout Plan

- **Phase 1 (MVP, dormant)** — ship extended plan shape, orchestrator, SSE events. All production routers classify `topology: 'bounded'`; iterative code path never exercised.
- **Phase 2 (Beta activation)** — enable router classification heuristic for explicit iterative-apt patterns. One sub-agent enabled for iterative initial directive.
- **Phase 3** — extend to all MVP sub-agents; expand router classification coverage.
- **Phase 4** — enable async iterative (plan 09 integration).
- **Phase 5 (GA)** — LLM-judge scorers promoted; per-iteration synthesis considered.

**Backout:** iterative is opt-in; disable by forcing router to always emit `topology: 'bounded'`. All turns fall back to bounded (some may fail if genuinely unfit — but safer than broken iterative). Config flag `agent.iterative.enabled = false`.

---

## 14. Dependencies

- Plan 01: gateway pipeline (tool calls per iteration).
- Plan 02: router + registry; plan shape extension.
- Plan 03: sub-agent runner + synthesizer (reused).
- Plan 04: memory (conversation state, L1 cache per iteration).
- Plan 05: cumulative cost enforcement.
- Plan 06: SSE iteration event triplet; abort propagation.
- Plan 07: 100% capture + topology-downgrade signal + new sampling trigger.
- Plan 08: draft taint bump across iterations.
- Plan 09: async iterative (Phase 4).
- Plan 10: `SetaScorer` registry + kind discriminator (ENFORCES R-12.10 at registration time).

## 15. Integration Points

- `apps/api/src/modules/agents/application/services/iterative-orchestrator.ts` — new.
- `apps/api/src/modules/agents/application/services/iterative-replanner.ts` — new.
- `apps/api/src/modules/agents/application/services/completion-scorer-runner.ts` — new; consumes plan 10's registry.
- `apps/api/src/modules/agents/application/services/iteration-ceiling-enforcer.ts` — new.
- `apps/api/src/modules/agents/infrastructure/schema/agent-iteration.ts` — Drizzle.
- Plan 02 `RouterPlan` type — extended.
- Plan 06 SSE state machine — extended to handle iteration triplet.
- Plan 07 sampling config — `topology: 'iterative'` added as trigger.

## 16. Activation Gate

Beta. Specific activation triggers:

- Router classifies first real open-ended task (internal-tenant test), OR
- Product explicitly scopes an iterative-apt feature.

Iterative code ships in MVP build (dormant) so plan 06 events are defined + infrastructure is tested via unit/integration.

## 17. Out of Scope

- LLM-judge completion scorers (GA; plan 10 meta-eval gate).
- Per-iteration synthesizer (GA).
- DAG / arbitrary graph execution (§16 Out of Scope).
- Mid-turn topology switch.
- Inline surface iterative (hard contract).
- Tenant-specific iteration cap configuration (default only; add if customer asks).

## 18. Open Questions

- **Router classification heuristic at MVP activation.** Keyword/pattern match? Explicit user toggle? Start with product-tunable allowlist of iterative-apt patterns; layer classification ML at GA if needed.
- **Re-plan context size management.** When iteration history exceeds N, compress older iterations via nano summarizer. Default N = 5 iterations raw, older compressed. Tune.
- **Async iterative checkpoint granularity.** pg-boss retry of an iterative turn — does it resume from last-iteration or restart from iteration 1 with same budget? Simpler at Beta: restart from 1; reconsider if retries become common.
- **Wallclock ceiling for iterative.** 60s default; specific per-surface configurability? Owner: product.
- **Cost-budget for iterative vs bounded.** Iterative naturally costs more; separate ceiling or same? Recommend: same budget, different expected utilization profile; monitor and tune.
- **Topology-downgrade-candidate signal threshold.** What rate triggers operator review? Start at 2% sustained over 24h.
